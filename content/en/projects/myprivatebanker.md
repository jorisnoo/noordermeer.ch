My Private Banker is a prototype for a mobile app developed within a very short timescale. It calculates individual investment models in the context of professional financial advice. This is precisely tailored to the entered asset and income situation and - in expert mode - to the user's personal risk tolerance.

My Private Banker is a Progressive Web App, quasi the symbiosis of a mobile website and a mobile application. It combines the advantages of both systems: A `Progressive Web App` runs in the browser, thus it does not have to be developed for different operating systems and installed by the user, but it also works offline and offers the possibility to access smartphone functions.

The demo version shows how My Private Banker can be accessed simply by URL - and delivers results with high performance.
