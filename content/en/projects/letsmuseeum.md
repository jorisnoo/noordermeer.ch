\#letsmuseeum offers guided tours and workshops: in museums, cities, companies and in different languages. Y7K's brutalist designed web presence is the central interface between the outside and the inside - between the audience, clients and the organization, which has a comprehensive and dynamic working tool with [letsmuseeum.com](https://letsmuseeum.com). 

The development of the backend was accordingly complex and challenging: Acquiring and formulating events, taking up and communicating offers, selling tickets and handling payments, recording participants and cancellations, assigning guides, sending reminders. Everything was consistently integrated, smartly linked and automated as far as possible. #letsmuseum works.
