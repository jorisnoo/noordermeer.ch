The web presence for the architectural office [Krucker](https://www.buerokrucker.ch) designed by the design studio [Badesaison](https://badesaison.ch) is a classic corporate website. It reflects the company profile and gives the user an impression of how Krucker thinks and acts.

On the surface, the content is presented in a strictly structured manner, in a lively interplay of different elements — white space, images, text — always adapted to the real situation; the size of the browser window. The filter criteria, which break down the entire content, serve for easy orientation. The topic pages are not rebuilt but are displayed in a new way by animated transitions. This looks elegant and is done completely fluidly.

The management of the data is done in the user-friendly <span class="code">Craft CMS,</span> which is used for the website of Krucker Architects according to the <span class="code">headless</span> principle: data storage and management in the back end is separated from the front end, a static site based on the framework <span class="code">Nuxt.js</span> which obtains and presents the data via an API. A headless architecture makes a web presence more flexible to use and easier to change. Both in the backend and in the frontend a noticeable performance gain is possible.
