I am Joris Noordermeer. I develop websites and web applications. I design the optimal technical architecture for a project, convert design into code, perfect visual interactions and implement content management systems. As a freelance full stack frontend/&#8203;backend developer, I support teams and agencies that value consistent web presences, intuitive user experiences and trouble-free functioning — in collaborative work processes and projects. Some selected [works](/work) give an overview of the spectrum of my concrete experiences and competences.

I built my first websites in my early teenage years. There were ideas about what something could look like and how it would function — and ways to reach the goal were always found. Sometimes I would work for a designer, whom I could give exactly what they imagined, sometimes I would work in an IT company, which gave me the chance to experience the practical side of things. I ended up sticking to programming — during several stays in Tokyo and here in my hometown Zurich, where I brought my know-how to the digital agency [Y7K](https://y7k.com) as a partner and technical director in 2014. 

Currently, I enjoy my passion for web development on a freelance basis, alongside a degree in philosophy. If you would like to learn more about me and my digital craft, I look forward to [hearing](/contact) from you.
